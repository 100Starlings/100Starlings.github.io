As a remote first company, it's been mostly business as usual for team
starlings, although we had to readjust nonetheless to the changes in circumstances
imposed by the (more or less strict) lockdown, some clients having to slow down
to adapt to the situation, and having the whole family at home (which is nice, btw).

Among the achievements from this week:

* The whole team has been busy helping [Collect+](https://www.collectplus.co.uk) adapt and deal with the impact
  of the pandemic. You're pure awesome ‚≠êÔ∏è

* On top of that, **Alex** moved the furniture from our old office in Budapest to the new spot,
although it's going to be a while before we can enjoy it together. We will get
there üí™.

Conversations and plans for our virtual retreat have been postponed so far to be
able to better support our clients, but we'll try to come up with something next
week.

Until then, stay safe & healthy. ‚ù§Ô∏è
