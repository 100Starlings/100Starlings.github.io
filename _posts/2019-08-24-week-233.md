Welcome to the second instalment of our weekly notes. We're still getting the
gist of it, so bear with us while we experiment.
This 

## Around the web
* We came across this [remote work
  report](https://usefyi.com/remote-work-report/); it's nice to know more and
  more companies are joining in the remote work bandwagon... but even more so, that people are enjoying
  working remotely, and finding this approach effective and rewarding.
  Yay us for staying ahead of the curve.
* Rails 6 [is official](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/8/15/Rails-6-0-final-release/)!
> [...] And we’ve been itching to use its multiple database support - we’ve got a project where running [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/ "A cloud based MySQL compatible relational database") and [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/ "A cloud based data warehouse") (more on that later) would be beneficial.
> It’s also always worth remembering that multiple database support can be a boon not just for different databases, but also for accessing the same data (that’s perhaps replicated, etc) under a different connection 
>  In the past we’ve had to mess around with shadow classes (a main model, and a shadow model that inherits but overrides database connections in order to have the same data available in read-only, different usage load mode) and database connections, when for example connecting to a fast, read-only replica. 
> No longer, the promised land awaits!

* Uncle Bob wrote a post [praising Clojure](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html); while being primarily a Ruby (on Rails) shop, we like keeping our options open to be able to pick the best tool for the task at hand. [Clojure](https://clojure.org), in particular, is among my personal favourites, and it's proving to be a true blessing in <abbr title="A small, elegant, cute, text centric app">project Cub</abbr>.


## The 'hood

[Show&Tell](https://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-events), the monthly event organised by our good friends at GoFreeRange is [no more](https://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-no-more) :(

Even if we didn’t manage to always participate (or contribute), the appointment (and the punctual notes) have always been something to look forward to, and a great source of inspiration; so much so, that GFR’s announcement sparked the conversation within our ranks that eventually led us to start publishing this blog, in part for our benefit of course, but also as a way to give back and maybe provide a flicker of inspiration to you, the reader.

<abbr title="our flagship (well, flagcar)">Red Herring</abbr> moved east with Alex on Thursday. More on that in a future post but, long story short, we use this [low impact / low operation-cost vehicle](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/models) to move our crew across Europe; it will be back in the UK before the end of October because, you know, brexit :-/

Speaking of dates and Europe: most of the 100S team will be in Budapest in September for [Code Beam Lite Budapest](https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-lite-budapest/); László [will be speaking](https://codesync.global/speaker/laszlo-bacsi/), we will have a booth there, and yes, there will be (super secret, not plastic) gadgets too!

## Project updates

So what actually has the team been up to during the week? Well, August has been a strange month so far. You would expect it to be quiet, but...

* One of our major clients lost a key member of their internal dev team, so we
had to handle the extra load, absorb and redistribute responsibilities &
know-how. Fun times. 
Mostly we miss the daily interaction with said developer though, we hope to chat with him regularly on [#friends](/2019/08/16/week-01-or-232.html#social).
Thank you everybody, but especially Zoli for being super reliable and Norbi for stepping in when needed.
* I’ve been brushing up on [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and [serverless AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) in general for a small but very “colorful” project that is due soon.
Let’s call it <abbr title="think generative video processing, in the cloud">project shoeshine</abbr> 
* Alex’s been following a new lead, and as a result he’s likely going to spend more time in London in September.
That means more face to face time, that is always precious (regardless of the [Discord server](/2019/08/16/week-01-or-232.html#social))
* Me and Richie are also making slow but steady progress on the aforementioned <abbr title="A small, elegant, cute, text centric app">project Cub</abbr>. Technically speaking it’s a pure clojure(script) application, and the features we’re currently working on required a deep dive in the Google Closure compiler & library. Not for the faint of heart, but honestly quite enthralling, [in a nerdy way](https://xkcd.com/356/).
* Last but not least, this very blog. Collecting all the thoughts, sorting through the achievements and selecting the highlights of the week on behalf of the whole team is proving a challenging but very enriching process: much like a small scale retrospective, it gives us an opportunity for collecting data points on our recent work, self reflect, and eventually celebrate our undertakings.

And one more thing: thank you for enduring the experience of reading these lines on our current website; it was never meant to host long form content, so it must be a bit of a painful experience. The good news is that Dori’s working on a solution to that.
