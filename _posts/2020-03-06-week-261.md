Mainly we cancelled our retreat planned for later this month in, you guessed it, Italy of all places; dear _bel paese_, we'll see you at another time.

In lieu of that, we're considering a virtual retreat. We'll share progress on that too.

In the meantime, **Alex** and **Lajos** made good progress to find us a new spot
to call "home" in Budapest;
that's a lot of legalese in two languages, not for the faint of heart.

**Riccardo** met with a charity on Thursday to discuss potential work together.
Our experience on [Streetbank](https://www.streetbank.com) could result particularly useful on this one... and
could let us have the opportunity to give Streetbank some of the love it deserves.
